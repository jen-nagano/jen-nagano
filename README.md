## Hello, 

I am a software developer based in the Cleveland area.  

I am currently expanding my web development skills and working on a project for the Shade Tree Commission of Chagrin Falls. ðŸŒ²

I taught high school math and computer science for 20 years and I am always happy to engage with fellow lifelong learners.
